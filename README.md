## Overview

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.16.0. and is part of an extracurricular Udacity project.
I created this project from the beginning using AngularJS v1.7.2,
Firebase Apis to ensure secure access and have an online database
and Google Maps Apis to find the locations of events and show them on the map.

This Single-Page App allows all users to create an account and be able to view, create or delete events.

## Installation

For start the Web App you need to install the necessary module:
```bash
$ npm install
```

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
